An electronics engineer. I started my career developing embedded systems.
This led me explore web technologies as the need arose to send data via GPRS from sensors to a database. 
I received a scholarship for a master's degree.The scholarship was awarded on the condition that I had to work on a project to develop an exercising tool for the elderly using Microsoft Kinect. 
I developed routines to handle sensor data and packed them in a DLL. This project was completed in May 2016. 
As a result of such efforts I became acquainted with the C# programming language. 
I worked in the US for two months as a research assistant at the University of Delaware, as part of the university's summer research internship programme. 
I was hired upon my return to Colombia at a local startup that developed accounting software on the cloud. 
My main duties involved developing java code on the server side to transfer data to and from databases. 
I worked as java back-end developer for Globant. My assignments have included projects for multiple international clients.
I worked on developing chatbot platforms that connect to dialogflow or rasa to interact with users. 
Now working as a software engineer for Epam.
